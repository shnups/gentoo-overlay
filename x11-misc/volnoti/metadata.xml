  <longdescription lang="en">
    Volnoti is a lightweight volume notification daemon for GNU/Linux and other POSIX
    operating systems.
    
    It is based on GTK+ and D-Bus and should work with any sensible window manager.
    
    The original aim was to create a volume notification daemon for lightweight window
    managers like LXDE or XMonad. It is known to work with a wide range of WMs,
    including GNOME, KDE, Xfce, LXDE, XMonad, i3 and many others. The source code is
    heavily based on the GNOME notification-daemon.
