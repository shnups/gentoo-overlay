    Minify and Secure Docker containers (free and open source!)

    Keep doing what you are doing. No need to change anything. Use the base
    image you want. Use the package manager you want. Don't worry about hand
    optimizing your Dockerfile. You shouldn't have to throw away your tools and
    your workflow to have small container images.

    Don't worry about manually creating Seccomp and AppArmor security profiles.
    You shouldn't have to become an expert in Linux syscalls, Seccomp and
    AppArmor to have secure containers. Even if you do know enough about it
    wasting time reverse engineering your application behavior can be
    time-consuming.

    docker-slim will optimize and secure your containers by understanding your
    application and what it needs using various analysis techniques. It will
    throw away what you don't need, reducing the attack surface of your
    container. What if you need some of those extra things to debug your
    container? You can use dedicated debugging side-car containers for that
    (more details below).
