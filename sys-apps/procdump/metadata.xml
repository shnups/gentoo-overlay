  <longdescription>
    ProcDump is a command-line utility whose primary purpose is monitoring an 
    application for CPU spikes and generating crash dumps during a spike that 
    an administrator or developer can use to determine the cause of the spike.
    
    ProcDump also includes hung window monitoring (using the same definition 
    of a window hang that Windows and Task Manager use), unhandled exception 
    monitoring and can generate dumps based on the values of system 
    performance counters.

    It also can serve as a general process dump utility that you can embed in 
    other scripts.
