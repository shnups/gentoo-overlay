  <longdescription>
    GLab is an open source GitLab CLI tool bringing GitLab to your terminal next to
    where you are already working with git and your code without switching between
    windows and browser tabs. Work with issues, merge requests, watch running pipelines
    directly from your CLI among other features. Inspired by gh, the official GitHub
    CLI tool.

    glab is available for repositories hosted on GitLab.com and self-hosted GitLab
    Instances. glab supports multiple authenticated GitLab instances and automatically
    detects the authenticated hostname from the remotes available in the working git
    directory.
