    Pistol is a file previewer for command line file managers such as Ranger
    and Lf intended to replace the file previewer scope.sh commonly used with
    them.

    scope.sh is a Bash script that uses case switches and external programs to
    decide how to preview every file it encounters. It knows how to handle
    every file according to it's MIME type and/or file extension using case
    switches and external programs. This design makes it hard to configure and
    maintain and it makes it slow for startup and heavy when running.

    Pistol is a Go program (with (almost) 0 dependencies) and it's MIME type
    detection is internal. Moreover, it features native preview support for
    almost any archive file and for text files along with syntax highlighting
    while scope.sh relies on external programs to do these basic tasks.
