    What happens when you boot up a Pod? What happens to a Service before it is
    allocated a public IP address? How often is a Deployment's status changing?

    kubespy is a small tool that makes it easy to observe how Kubernetes resources
    change in real time, derived from the work we did to make Kubernetes deployments
    predictable in Pulumi's CLI. Run kubespy at any point in time, and it will
    watch and report information about a Kubernetes resource continuously until
    you kill it.
