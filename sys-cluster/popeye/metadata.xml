  <longdescription>Popeye is a utility that scans live Kubernetes cluster and reports potential
    issues with deployed resources and configurations. It sanitizes your cluster based on what's
    deployed and not what's sitting on disk. By scanning your cluster, it detects misconfigurations
    and helps you to ensure that best practices are in place, thus preventing future headaches. It
    aims at reducing the cognitive overload one faces when operating a Kubernetes cluster in the
    wild. Furthermore, if your cluster employs a metric-server, it reports potential resources
    over/under allocations and attempts to warn you should your cluster run out of capacity. Popeye
    is a readonly tool, it does not alter any of your Kubernetes resources in any way!</longdescription>
