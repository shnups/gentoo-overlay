    Kubernetes for Prod, Tilt for Dev

    Modern apps are made of too many services. They're everywhere and in 
    constant communication.

    Tilt powers microservice development and makes sure they behave! Run tilt up
    to work in a complete dev environment configured for your team.

    Tilt automates all the steps from a code change to a new process: watching
    files, building container images, and bringing your environment up-to-date.
    Think docker build && kubectl apply or docker-compose up.
